# php.nvim

Plugin to make php dev easier in neovim.

- [x] Automatically setup `tree-sitter-blade` and bundle queries
- [ ] Run `composer dump-autoload` when:
  - When `composer.json` changes


- Install:
  - Blade formatter
  - Intelephenese (but should do more exploring w/ phpactor)


# Notes

> Livewire components can be made with 2 files (1 php, 1 blade) or 1 file (php
> + blade), blade components can be 2 files (1 php and 1 blade) 1 file
> ("headless" only blade) or 1 file (php + blade ). That is one of the issues
> when working to go to the definition you intend, either blade or php
> depending if you intend to edit the "view" or the "controller"
